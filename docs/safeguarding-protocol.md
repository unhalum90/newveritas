# Mental Health Crisis Protocol: Designated Safeguarding Lead (DSL) Response

**Product:** SayVeritas
**Scope:** Designated Safeguarding Leads (DSLs) and Deputy DSLs in UK Educational Institutions.
**Purpose:** To provide a standardized procedure for responding to automated crisis alerts generated by the SayVeritas platform.

---

## 1. Overview of the Alert System
SayVeritas monitors student oral transcripts for keywords associated with self-harm, suicide, and extreme distress. When an alert is triggered:
1. An automated email is sent instantly to the school's configured DSL email address.
2. The submission is flagged in the SayVeritas Teacher Dashboard with a "Shield" icon.
3. The alert is logged in the administrative Oversight Dashboard.

## 2. Immediate Response Steps (First 15 Minutes)
Upon receiving a crisis alert, the DSL must:
- **Acknowledge:** Access the SayVeritas dashboard to view the specific excerpt that triggered the alert.
- **Contextualize:** Review the student's full response and current activity to determine if the keyword was used in an academic context (e.g., discussing literature or history) or indicates personal distress.
- **Locate Student:** Determine the student's current location within the school.

## 3. Risk Assessment Matrix
| Indicator | Contextual Clue | Action Level |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Academic** | Keyword used in relation to a specific text (e.g., "Romeo and Juliet"). | **Level 1:** Log as reviewed; no further action unless other concerns exist. |
| **Ambiguous** | Student mentions hopelessness but without specific intent. | **Level 2:** Informal check-in by student support or tutor. |
| **High Risk** | First-person statements of intent or specific plans. | **Level 3:** Immediate face-to-face intervention; follow school safeguarding policy. |

## 4. Intervention Procedures
### Level 2 & 3 Interventions
1. **Face-to-Face Check:** A member of the safeguarding team should engage the student in a private setting.
2. **Referral:** Follow standard school referral paths to CAMHS, school counselors, or emergency services if necessary.
3. **Parent/Guardian Notification:** Contact parents as per the school's "immediate risk" policy.

## 5. Documentation and Audit
- **SayVeritas Log:** Ensure the alert is marked as "Actioned" in the platform (feature pending in Story 4.1.x).
- **CPOMS/School Record:** All Level 2 and Level 3 interventions MUST be logged in the school's primary safeguarding software (e.g., CPOMS, MyConcern).
- **Review:** Periodically review false positive rates with Veritas Support to refine keyword matching.
