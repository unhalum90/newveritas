# SayVeritas: Safety and Compliance Overview (UK)

SayVeritas is built with a "Safety by Design" philosophy, specifically tailored to meet the rigorous standards of UK educational institutions, DfE guidance, and UK GDPR.

## 1. Core Safety Features

### Real-Time Crisis Detection
Our platform uses integrated AI to monitor student oral transcripts for high-risk language associated with mental health crises or safeguarding concerns.
- **Instant Alerts:** Designated Safeguarding Leads (DSLs) are notified immediately via email.
- **Contextual Awareness:** Excerpts are provided to helps DSLs quickly distinguish between academic discussion and personal distress.

### Academic Integrity Monitoring
We help teachers ensure that student work is authentic and original through:
- **Tab-Switch Monitoring:** Alerts when students leave the assessment screen.
- **Screenshot Prevention:** Logs and discourages attempts to capture assessment content.
- **Integrity Dashboard:** Aggregated reports for school leaders to monitor trends.

### Student Well-being Controls
- **Session Duration Monitoring:** Detects protracted student interactions that may indicate anxiety or "perfectionistic" re-recording behavior.
- **Mandatory Breaks:** Reminders and daily limits to ensure students maintain a healthy relationship with technology.

## 2. AI Ethics and Compliance

### Anti-Anthropomorphization
To support healthy emotional development, SayVeritas AI uses objective, function-based language. 
- **Functional Personas:** AI identified as a "Feedback Utility," not a "Friend" or "Tutor."
- **Language Standards:** Strict avoidance of "I/Me/My/We" statements to prevent psychological bonding.

### Data Privacy (UK GDPR)
- **UK South Data Residency:** Primary data storage in UK/European regions.
- **Zero Training Policy:** Student data is processed via enterprise APIs and never used to train global AI models.
- **Data Minimization:** No PII (names/emails) is sent to third-party AI providers; we use internal unique identifiers.

## 3. Procurement Resources
- **DPIA:** A comprehensive Data Protection Impact Assessment is available upon request.
- **Privacy Notice:** Transparent, recurring notices for students and teachers.
- **Safeguarding Protocol:** Standardized templates for DSL response procedures.
