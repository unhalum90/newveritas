# Regulatory Monitoring Plan (UK)

To ensure SayVeritas remains at the forefront of UK educational technology standards, we maintain a proactive regulatory monitoring system.

## Monitoring Channels
*   **Government Portals:** Monthly review of [gov.uk/education](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education) for AI guidance updates.
*   **BESA Alerts:** Subscription to the British Educational Suppliers Association (BESA) newsletters for policy changes.
*   **ICO Updates:** Monitoring Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) rulings on AI and biometric data in schools.
*   **EdTech UK:** Active participation in EdTech UK community forums to track emerging best practices.

## Quarterly Legal Check-in
We schedule a quarterly call with our UK legal counsel to review:
1.  Changes to UK GDPR enforcement.
2.  New DfE "Safety Standards for AI in Education."
3.  Emerging requirements for "Voice Biometrics" (if applicable in future).

## Evaluation Template (Regulatory Gap Analysis)
When a regulatory change is identified:
1.  **Requirement:** [State the new regulation]
2.  **Current Status:** [How we currently address this, or if we don't]
3.  **Impact Level:** [Low/Medium/High]
4.  **Remediation Plan:** [Technical or procedural changes needed]
5.  **Deadline:** [Statutory deadline for compliance]

## Internal Communication
All regulatory findings are logged in the `#uk-compliance` Slack channel for immediate team awareness.
