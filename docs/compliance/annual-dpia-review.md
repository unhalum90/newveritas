# Annual DPIA Review System

## Review Frequency

*   **Triggered Review:** A review must be conducted whenever there is a significant change to the platform's data processing activities (e.g., new AI models, storage changes, or third-party integrations).

## Responsible Persons
*   **Data Protection Officer (DPO):** Eric Chamberlin
*   **External Consultant:** [Consultant Name/Firm]
*   **Technical Lead:** Eric Chamberlin

## Review Checklist
1. [ ] **Data Flow Audit:** Verify that the current data flows match the diagrams in the DPIA.
2. [ ] **AI Model Assessment:** Document any changes to AI models used for transcription, scoring, or follow-up.
3. [ ] **Third-Party Subprocessors:** Confirm all subprocessors (e.g., Speechace, Vercel) still comply with the Data Processing Agreement (DPA).
4. [ ] **Risk Mitigation Verification:** Ensure all risks identified in the previous DPIA remain mitigated by the current technical controls.
5. [ ] **Safeguarding Logs:** Review crisis detection logs to ensure the protocol is being followed and false positive/negative rates are acceptable.
