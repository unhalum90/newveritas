Veritas Study Lab: Universal Design for Learning (UDL)Objective: Ensure the "Scan-to-Voice" Socratic workflow is accessible to students who cannot provide a physical/analog artifact due to technical, physical, or cognitive barriers.1. Alternative "Dialogue On-Ramps"If a student cannot scan a document, the system must provide three fallback methods to initiate the "Stretch" dialogue.A. The "Voice Memo" Seed (Audio-Only)The Workflow: "I don't have notes to scan today." -> "No problem! Tell me in 30 seconds what you remember most from today's lesson/reading."The Logic: The system uses Speech-to-Text (STT) to generate the "Context" for the AI, replacing the Vision API's OCR data.Target: Students with motor impairments or those working in environments where mobile scanning isn't feasible.B. The "Digital Direct" Seed (Text-Only)The Workflow: Student types a bulleted list or a summary directly into a "Prep Box."The Logic: The AI analyzes the typed text as the "Artifact."Target: Students who prefer digital note-taking or have low bandwidth that prevents image uploads.C. The "Unit Skeleton" Seed (Teacher-Provided)The Workflow: If the student has nothing to provide, they select "Help me start."The Logic: The system uses the Teacher's Lesson Plan or Learning Targets for that unit to generate a generic Socratic question.Target: Students who struggle with executive function and "don't know where to start" with their notes.2. Technical Implementation for AccessibilityScreen Reader & NavigationRequirement: The Study Lab interface must be fully navigable via keyboard (Tab/Enter) and compatible with ARIA labels for screen readers.OCR Fallback: When a student does scan a document, the system must generate a "Hidden Text Description" of what it found so a visually impaired student can hear what the AI is about to ask them."Low-Stress" UI TogglesCamera Anxiety Mode: Allow the student to replace the "Camera View" with an "Audio Visualizer" icon so they aren't staring at themselves while they think out loud.Font Controls: Integration with OpenDyslexic or high-contrast themes for the transcript display.3. Pedagogical GuardrailsNo Penalty for Method: The Class Analysis Report (CAR) should show the teacher what the student understood, not how they uploaded it.Accommodated Prompts: If a student is identified in the database with an IEP/504, the AI "Study Buddy" should adjust its complexity (e.g., shorter questions, more sentence stems).4.
