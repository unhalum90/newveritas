## Problem Section

**Section Headline:** "The Grading Treadmill Is Killing Good Teaching"

**Three-Column Layout:**

**Column 1: The Time Trap**
- Icon: Clock with red X
- Copy: "Biology teacher with 90 students spends 6+ hours grading one assessment. By the time they finish, the moment for intervention has passed."

**Column 2: The Scale Problem**  
- Icon: Speaking student + teacher overwhelmed
- Copy: "Oral assessments reveal deep understanding—but they don't scale. One 5-minute conversation with each student = 7.5 hours for a single class."

**Column 3: The Integrity Crisis**
- Icon: Phone with answers being shared
- Copy: "In the TikTok era, answers spread faster than you can grade. Traditional assessments can't keep up with modern cheating."

**Transition Copy:** "What if you could assess student understanding through authentic oral responses—at scale—with confidence in academic integrity?"

## Solution Section

**Section Headline:** "Assessment That Thinks Like a Professor, Scales Like Technology"

**How It Works - 4 Steps with Icons:**

**Step 1: Teacher Creates Assessment**
- Icon: Teacher at computer
- Copy: "Upload your essential question. SayVeritas generates 5-8 cognitively equivalent questions so students can't share answers."
- Detail: "Same Bloom's level. Same rigor. Different surface content."

**Step 2: Students Record Responses**
- Icon: Student speaking into phone/laptop
- Copy: "Students answer via voice—anytime, anywhere. Perfect for student-athletes, mobile learners, and asynchronous classes."
- Detail: "Built-in academic integrity checks run invisibly in the background."

**Step 3: AI Scores & Flags**
- Icon: AI analyzing waveform
- Copy: "AI evaluates understanding and asks Socratic follow-up questions to probe deeper. Results ready in minutes, not hours."
- Detail: "Behavioral flags (unusual speed, suspicious pauses, tab switching) sent to teacher for review."

**Step 4: Teachers Intervene Where It Matters**
- Icon: Teacher having 1-on-1 conversation with student
- Copy: "Spend your time on the 10-15% who need you—not mindlessly grading the 80% who get it."
- Detail: "Students who perform outside their expected range get your attention. Everyone else keeps learning."

**Dev Team Notes:**
- This is a high-intent landing page for educators evaluating solutions—not a consumer product page
- Tone: Professional but not corporate. Empathetic to teacher pain points.
- Goal: Convert to beta signups, not immediate sales
- Include tracking for scroll depth, CTA clicks, form abandonment
