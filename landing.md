Testimonials focused on opportunity, not problems:
Time Freedom:
"I used to spend 8 hours every weekend grading. Now I spend 45 minutes reviewing insights and 6 hours with my family. This isn't just efficiency - it's career sustainability."
— High School History Teacher
Student Success:
"My ESL students finally have a way to show deep understanding without perfect grammar. My athlete who never had time for essays can now demonstrate mastery. Every student has found their voice."
— Middle School Science Teacher
Teaching Impact:
"The diagnostic data changed how I teach. I see patterns instantly that used to take weeks to identify. I can intervene when concepts are fresh, not after students have moved on."

Unexpected Wins:
"Students actually prefer this. They say it feels more like a real conversation than a test. Lower anxiety, higher engagement, better results."

Headline: "And Yes, Integrity Is Built In"
Framing: "When students speak their understanding through Socratic dialogue, authenticity is inherent - not policed."
Four quiet confidence builders:
Question Rotation
"Bank of cognitively equivalent questions means no two students answer the same prompt."
Socratic Follow-Ups
"AI adapts questions to student's actual response - impossible to prepare answers in advance."
Behavioral Insights
"Teachers receive context (response patterns, timing) to inform their professional judgment."
Authentic Dialogue
"Can't fake understanding in a conversation. Either you know it or you don't."
