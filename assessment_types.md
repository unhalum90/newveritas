SayVeritas: Hear What They Truly Understand


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. The Challenge: Why Traditional Assessment is Failing in the Age of AI

The rapid integration of generative AI into students' lives has created an unprecedented challenge for educators. It is now easier than ever for learners to generate text that appears competent, making it difficult to distinguish between authentic student work and sophisticated AI output. This new reality not only undermines the validity of written assignments but also fosters an over-reliance on technology that can diminish the development of independent learning and critical thinking skills.

The Problem	The Impact on Learning & Teaching
Vulnerability to AI	Students increasingly use AI as a "crutch" for written work, bypassing the learning process and submitting polished but unearned answers. This fosters "superficial learning" where understanding is shallow.
"Right Answer" Conditioning	For 12 years, the education system has trained students to find the correct answer, often at the expense of explaining how they arrived at it. This conditioning leaves them unprepared to articulate their own reasoning.
Hidden AI Usage	Research reveals a significant gap between students' self-reported AI use (~60%) and their estimates of peer usage (~90%). This "social desirability bias" creates a culture of secrecy, preventing open dialogue about ethical AI use.
Teacher Burnout	The immense time required to grade written work and provide meaningful feedback is a primary driver of educator burnout. In contrast, SayVeritas is designed to save teachers upwards of 20 hours per semester.

SayVeritas directly confronts these challenges by introducing a new paradigm—one where a student's thought process is the primary evidence of learning.

2. The Solution: A "Centaur" Approach to Oral Assessment

The SayVeritas philosophy is grounded in a strategic model of human-AI collaboration. We call this the "centaur" approach, where the platform is designed to augment and empower the teacher, not replace them. The AI performs the heavy lifting of transcription, initial scoring, and data analysis, while the educator remains the ultimate authority on student mastery and provides the mentorship that only a human can.

* Authentic Reasoning Over Recitation: SayVeritas requires students to articulate their thinking in real-time, responding to prompts and adaptive follow-up questions. This makes it nearly impossible to "fake" understanding with a pre-written script, as the assessment reveals their cognitive process, not just a memorized answer.
* Human-AI Synergy: The platform embodies a true "centaur" model. The AI handles time-intensive, repetitive tasks, while the teacher provides the professional judgment and pedagogical expertise. Research confirms this approach leads to "superior collaborative performance," allowing educators and AI to achieve better outcomes together than either could alone.
* A Psychologically Safe Space: Many students fear speaking up in class. The asynchronous, non-judgmental AI provides a private, safe environment for students to practice articulating their thoughts. This reduces the "evaluative anxiety" that can inhibit learning and builds the confidence needed for high-stakes communication.
* Unbundling the Teacher's Role: By automating routine grading and analysis, SayVeritas "unbundles" the teacher's role. It reclaims valuable hours, freeing educators from tedious tasks to focus on high-impact activities like one-on-one coaching, small-group intervention, and designing richer learning experiences.

This innovative approach unlocks a new world of creative and authentic assessments that were previously logistically impossible to implement at scale.

3. Redefining Assessment: Creative & Authentic Formats

Moving beyond the limitations of multiple-choice and static essays opens up a world of dynamic assessment opportunities. SayVeritas enables educators to deploy creative formats that measure a far wider range of critical thinking, synthesis, and communication skills—all within a scalable, efficient platform.

Document-Based & Visual Retell In this format, students are presented with a source—such as a historical document, a data chart, or a unique "Visual Integrity Asset" like a scientific diagram—for a limited time. The material then disappears, and the student must explain its meaning and significance from memory. This assesses not only comprehension but also a student's ability to internalize and synthesize information quickly.

Artifact + Explanation This powerful format bridges the digital and physical worlds. Students upload a photo of their tangible work—be it a lab setup, a math solution on a whiteboard, a historical diorama, or an art project—and then record an oral defense of their process, choices, and reasoning. It transforms static projects into dynamic demonstrations of understanding.

Single & Sequential Prompts SayVeritas offers teachers the flexibility to design assessments of varying complexity. They can build an assessment around a single, powerful open-ended question or craft a multi-step dialogue that uses sequential prompts to guide a student through a complex line of reasoning, revealing their ability to build an argument step by step.

These innovative formats are powered by a suite of core features designed to probe for deep learning while ensuring academic integrity.

4. Core Features for Deep Learning & Academic Integrity

SayVeritas was intentionally designed with a suite of integrated tools to both probe for deeper understanding and ensure the authenticity of every student response. These features work in concert to create an assessment environment that is both rigorous and fair.

1. Adaptive Socratic Follow-Ups The platform's AI goes beyond passive listening. Based on a student’s specific initial response, it generates adaptive probes designed to elicit Clarification, Depth, Challenge, or Application. This Socratic method prevents recitation of memorized answers and reveals the true depth of a student's understanding by requiring them to think on their feet.
2. Visual Integrity Assets This advanced feature combats answer-sharing by generating unique visual materials—such as diagrams, charts, or maps—for each individual student. Because no two students see the exact same prompt, they are forced to engage in genuine analysis rather than relying on a peer's interpretation, ensuring the integrity of the assessment.
3. AI-Powered Dual Rubric Scoring SayVeritas employs a sophisticated two-agent scoring system to provide nuanced feedback. Agent Alpha evaluates higher-order skills like Reasoning & Synthesis, while Agent Beta assesses content knowledge, including Evidence & Accuracy. This system, powered by leading models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet, gives teachers a detailed, multi-faceted view of student performance.
4. Robust Integrity Suite To ensure responses are authentic and spontaneous, the platform includes a comprehensive integrity suite. Features like question rotation (delivering different prompt variations to students), focus monitoring (tracking tab switches), and pause detection (flagging unusually long silences) work together to uphold academic honesty.

This entire approach, from the assessment formats to the core features, is validated by a strong foundation in modern educational research.

5. Grounded in Research: The Pedagogy Behind the Platform

SayVeritas is not just a technology tool; it is a pedagogical system built upon key findings from recent educational research. Its design principles are directly informed by a series of 2025 studies that highlight the most effective ways to integrate AI into teaching and learning.

* Enhancing Human-AI Synergy: A study by Riedl & Weidmann (2025) found that a "centaur" model, where humans and AI collaborate, leads to superior performance. SayVeritas embodies this by positioning the AI as a teacher's assistant, creating a synergistic partnership that enhances efficiency and instructional quality.
* Preventing "Superficial Learning": Research from Delikoura et al. (2025) warns that passive use of AI can lead to shallow understanding. By requiring students to actively participate and articulate their thoughts orally, SayVeritas prevents the passive consumption of AI-generated answers and fosters deeper, more durable learning.
* Boosting Performance with Instant Feedback: A meta-analysis by Wang & Fan (2025) concluded that instant, personalized feedback significantly enhances student engagement and academic outcomes. SayVeritas delivers this at scale, providing immediate, rubric-aligned feedback that helps students learn from their responses right away.
* Promoting Skill Growth Through Active Collaboration: Research on human-AI work modes by Randazzo et al. (2025) showed that users who actively guide AI (the "Centaur" approach) upskill themselves, whereas those who fully automate tasks do not. SayVeritas is deliberately designed to keep students and teachers actively involved, ensuring AI is used for skill enhancement, not skill erosion.

These universal principles are applied in a versatile platform that adapts to the unique demands of any subject area.
