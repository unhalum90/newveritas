**Maine Learning Results for World Languages** 

**Introduction** 

**Languages are Essential for Success in a Global Community**   
Learning another language is a lifelong process that not only enhances a student's understanding of their first language, but also  allows access to the rich culture and perspectives of the community members of the target language. The Maine Learning Results  (MLRs) will thus reflect the interconnectedness and richness of human language and weave curricular elements, emphasizing that no  one goal can be achieved in isolation or separated from the others, nor is any one goal more important. Therefore, some  performance expectations will appear within multiple strands given the nature of intercultural communication. These MLRs define  what students should know and be able to do with the target language and place content and skill integration as the central focus of  instruction. This document is a framework that describes the standards to be met by Maine district language programs and is  designed to prepare all students for success upon graduation. The MLRs serve as a road map on the path to the Seal of Biliteracy.  Language programs invite, include, support, and benefit all students while empowering them to act as global citizens. 

**The Maine Learning Results for World Languages Framework**   
These standards are adapted from the national ACTFL World-Readiness Standards and the NCSSFL-ACTFL Can-Do Statements to  meet the MLR framework guidelines. They are purposefully designed to be broad in order to apply to all taught languages \- modern,  classical and signed \- and to leave space for teachers and districts to interpret and design curriculum in order to meet the  expectations of their programs. MLRs address what students can independently and consistently do over time in numerous learning  situations. They are a framework, not a curriculum or checklist or tool to determine a student's proficiency level. 

The MLRs continue to use the 5 ACTFL goal areas:   
• **Communication:** communicate effectively in more than one language in order to function in a variety of situations and for  multiple purposes. 

• **Cultures:** Interact with cultural competence and understanding.   
• **Connections:** Connect with other disciplines and acquire information and diverse perspectives in order to use the language  to function in academic and career related situations. 

• **Comparisons:** Develop insight into the nature of language and culture in order to interact with cultural competence. • **Communities:** Communicate and interact with cultural competence in order to participate in multilingual communities at  home and around the world. 

For more in-depth information on the 5 Cs, please see ACTFL’s World-Readiness Standards for Learning Languages. To view  ACTFL’s original guidelines and more specific examples for application, see ACTFL’s website: actfl.org. More specific ideas for  differentiation of language type and proficiency level are outlined in supplemental resources.

The MLRs are broken down into Performance Expectations. Grade levels from K-5 have distinct Performance Expectations, while in  grades 6-8 and grades 9-diploma Performance Expectations are consolidated. The Performance Expectations define skills and  establish measurable articulations of what the student understands and can do. Sample performance indicators define student  progress in meeting standards within the 5 C goal areas using the benchmarks of language development (Novice, Intermediate,  Advanced). The Maine Learning Results represent the ideal of a comprehensive K-12 program. At this time, the majority of school  districts in Maine are offering world languages beginning in middle or high school. For this reason, the framework is also organized  by linguistic proficiency. In order to access the most appropriate guidelines for students, regardless of their grade level, world  language programs should use the Novice Low proficiency guidelines (K/1) as a point of entry for students new to the language of  study or to determine placement for performance expectations. Students will move through the proficiency levels more or less quickly  depending on factors like age, amount of instruction/exposure, motivation, and family and community support. In a comprehensive K 12 program, the ultimate goal for students would be to communicate in all areas at the Advanced Low proficiency level. However,  later entry points lead to various levels of proficiency based on hours/years of study, as well as individual differences in programs  and learners. The following expectations are a general guideline and based on daily study in a full-year program: 

• Two years of study: Novice High   
• Four years of study: Intermediate Low   
• Six years of study: Intermediate Mid   
• Nine years of study: Intermediate High   
• Thirteen years of study: Advanced Low

**Fundamental Practices for Effective Implementation of the Maine Learning Results** 

Learning to use a second language in meaningful, authentic, and appropriate ways, is the ultimate goal of world language instruction.  Instructing in the target language 90% of the time, as recommended by ACTFL, may be achieved nearly all of the time, through age appropriate linguistic scaffolding. However, in limited cases, and for certain languages, it may be appropriate to leverage students’  primary languages judiciously in order to achieve the standard. 

Maine language classrooms foster risk-taking and mistake-making in order for students to grow in linguistic competence and cultural  awareness through relevant, cross-disciplinary, and motivational themes. Students are to see themselves in the curriculum, as well  as have a window to view others. Instruction is differentiated according to instructional context, target language, program design, and  student profile, so that it is appropriate and rigorous for all students. Because learners' lives and experiences are woven into our  proficiency guidelines, World Language classrooms are a center of Social Emotional Learning and Social Justice explorations and  connect students to their peers and to their communities.

Communication 

Today’s world language learners need to know how to communicate effectively in order to thrive in an ever-changing and challenging  global society. The communication standards for World Languages are broken down into three modes of communication:  interpersonal, interpretive, and presentational. Interpersonal communication encompasses spontaneous spoken, signed, or written  conversations in which learners interact and negotiate meaning. With interpretive communication, learners listen, read, or view  resources in order to understand, interpret, and analyze information. It should be noted that ACTFL guidelines are designed with the  assumption that resources are authentic, which accounts for a lower performance expectation than with teacher-created materials. In  the presentational mode of communication, learners share information, concepts, and ideas to an audience of listeners, readers, or  viewers.

| Interpersonal Communication  | Interpretive Communication  | Presentational Communication |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Students engage in conversations,  provide and obtain information,  express feelings and emotions, and  exchange opinions.** | **Learners understand, interpret, and  analyze what is heard, read, or viewed  on a variety of topics.** | **Learners present information,   concepts, and ideas to inform, explain,  persuade, and narrate on a variety of  topics using appropriate media and  adapting to various audiences of  listeners, readers, or viewers.** |

Cultures 

Culture, the products, practices, and achievements of a particular nation, people, or social group, is intricately woven throughout the  world’s languages. Using a target language to explore one’s own culture and the cultures that the target language embodies is an  experience that creates learners who are aware of and engage with a variety of different perspectives in local and global society, and  who are, ultimately, responsible and involved citizens of Maine and the world. Through interacting with global cultures in the World  Language classroom, virtually and in various settings and communities, using the target language exclusively or almost exclusively,  with appropriate linguistic scaffolding, and by identifying, comparing, investigating and reflecting on cultural products (e.g., arts, tools,  media) and practices (e.g., customs, laws, family rituals), learners will be equipped to interact with others with competence and  understanding.

Connections 

In order for students to become self-directed lifelong learners, integrated and informed thinkers and responsible citizens, they will  begin to make connections between the target language and other content areas starting at the novice level. Through their study of  another language, students will investigate a variety of products and practices that make them aware of cultural differences in  perspective and tap into their prior knowledge. As their abilities in the language grow, students will be able to effectively communicate those connections and explain the differences in cultural perspectives in their own language(s) and the target language  in a variety of topics. This depth of experience through a variety of activities in all content areas will serve to assist students as they  make decisions about their post-graduate work. The connections that students make between the language and particular areas of  interest will allow them to apply that knowledge in the workforce and navigate more successfully with other cultures in a global  community.

Comparisons 

Through the study of language, students are invited to engage with the multilingual and multicultural world within and beyond their  communities. By exploring diverse linguistic and cultural contexts, students make comparisons that enable them to better understand  their own and other environments, to function in a global society, and to become informed thinkers and responsible, involved citizens.  Developing insight into the nature of language and culture through comparisons involves investigating and reflecting upon the structure and function of language as well as the products and practices of culture. Comparing cultures leads to complex  discussions on community connectedness and the role of the individual within various cultures. Throughout the strand, teachers and  students are encouraged to employ a variety of media and technology to explore diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.

Communities 

When students are learning a new language, they are doing so in the context of others who use this language. Learning a new  language is a bridge to cultures, past, present, and future, and creates a personal connection for students and places them in a  community. A community is a group of people who share in a common experience. Community may refer to the school community, to  a student’s home or family, or to digital connections that are geographically close or throughout the world. Whether students are  learning a modern, classical, or signed language, and regardless of rural or urban setting, meaningful community connections enrich  their lives and encourage lifelong learning. When students’ language study is connected to a community, they are motivated to learn  because they can see the real-life application of their learning.
