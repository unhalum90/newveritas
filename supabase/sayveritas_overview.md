## What We Do

SayVeritas is a **voice-based oral assessment platform** for K-12 classrooms. Students respond to teacher-created questions by speaking, and AI handles transcription and rubric-aligned scoring—with teacher review before any grade is published.

### Core Capabilities

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Voice Recording** | Students record responses on any device (phone, tablet, laptop) |
| **AI Transcription** | Speech converted to text via OpenAI Whisper |
| **Dual-Model Scoring** | Two AI models (OpenAI + Google Gemini) score against teacher rubrics |
| **Socratic Follow-ups** | AI generates follow-up questions to probe understanding |
| **Teacher Review** | All AI scores require teacher approval before release |
| **Class Reports** | Evidence-linked insights on class-wide misconceptions |

## How We Do It

### The Assessment Flow

```
Teacher creates assessment → Students speak responses → 
AI transcribes + scores → Teacher reviews/overrides → 
Grades released to students
```

### AI Usage (Transparent by Design)

| AI Function | Provider | Data Processed |
|-------------|----------|----------------|
| Transcription | OpenAI Whisper | Audio → Text |
| Scoring (Model A) | OpenAI GPT | Transcript + Rubric |
| Scoring (Model B) | Google Gemini | Transcript + Rubric |
| Image Generation | OpenAI DALL-E | Text prompts only |

**Teacher Control:** Teachers can override any AI score with a required reason. All overrides are logged for accountability.

### What AI Does NOT Do
- ❌ No biometric identification of students
- ❌ No emotional or sentiment analysis
- ❌ No profiling or predictive analytics
- ❌ No training on student data

## Why We Do It

### The Problem
- Traditional assessment only hears from the 20-30% of students who raise their hands
- Written tests favor students who write quickly, not necessarily those who understand
- Teachers can't feasibly listen to 150+ student oral responses

### The Solution
- **100% participation**: Every student must respond, no hiding in the back row
- **Speaking practice**: 2-5 minutes of structured speaking per student per week
- **Time savings**: AI handles transcription and initial scoring, teacher reviews in minutes
- **Authentic assessment**: Students demonstrate understanding through explanation, not just recall
