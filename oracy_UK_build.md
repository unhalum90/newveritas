Below is a recreated PRD, rewritten to incorporate the insider constraints, political realities, and adoption mechanics we discussed. This is not just cleaner—it is procurement-safe, inspection-safe, and pilot-ready.

I’ve deliberately adjusted language to avoid red flags while strengthening your strategic moat.

Product Requirements Document (PRD)

SayVeritas UK — Project “Speak Britain”

⸻

1. Executive Summary (Reframed for the UK Reality)

As of the 2025/26 academic year, oracy is a statutory expectation within the UK National Curriculum, and schools are under increasing pressure to evidence intent, implementation, and impact in a way that is credible to inspectors, governors, and trusts.

SayVeritas UK (“Speak Britain”) is a UK-native Oracy Evidence Platform, purpose-built to help schools capture, structure, and present oracy evidence aligned with the Voice 21 Oracy Framework—without automating judgement, grading, or inspection outcomes.

Positioning principle (non-negotiable):
SayVeritas does not evaluate schools or predict inspection results.
It enables schools to retain ownership of professional judgement while dramatically reducing the burden of evidence collection.

⸻

2. Policy & Market Context (Insider Assumptions)

2.1 Statutory Oracy Expectation
	•	Oracy is now embedded across curriculum guidance rather than treated as enrichment.
	•	Schools must demonstrate progression, not isolated performance.
	•	Inspectors are increasingly looking for coherent narrative evidence, not scores.

2.2 EdTech & AI Compliance Landscape
	•	New UK government guidance (2025) introduces stringent expectations for:
	•	AI transparency
	•	Human-in-the-loop safeguards
	•	Data minimisation
	•	Auditability
	•	SayVeritas backend, reporting, and data handling have already been updated to meet these expectations, creating a first-mover compliance advantage.

⸻

3. Core UK Localisation (“The Basics Plus”)

3.1 Structural Alignment (Mandatory)

Curriculum Structure
	•	Replace US grade levels with Key Stages (KS):
	•	KS1–KS2: Primary (Years 1–6)
	•	KS3–KS4: Secondary (Years 7–11)
	•	KS5: Sixth Form (Years 12–13)

Assessment Language
	•	Remove letter grades entirely.
	•	Default to school-configurable descriptors aligned with common inspection language:
	•	Exceptional
	•	Strong Standard
	•	Expected Standard
	•	Needs Attention
	•	Urgent Improvement

These descriptors are templates, not mandates. Schools may rename, hide, or replace them.

⸻

4. The Oracy Strand Intelligence Engine (Core Differentiator)

SayVeritas UK replaces generic “fluency scoring” with strand-based oracy profiles, mapped directly to the Voice 21 Oracy Framework.

4.1 Strand Outputs (Per Recording)

Strand	Evidence Indicators (AI-Assisted, Not Judgemental)
Physical	Relative voice projection, pacing trends, tonal variation (tracked against student’s own baseline, never absolute thresholds)
Linguistic	Tier 2 (academic) and Tier 3 (subject-specific) vocabulary detection
Cognitive	Structural markers (“Firstly…”, “In conclusion…”) and reasoning markers (“because”, “therefore”, “based on…”)
Social	(Opt-in / Pilot phase) Turn-taking and responsive language in structured group tasks

Guardrail:
All strand outputs are labelled as “markers detected”, not quality judgements.

⸻

5. Inspection-Ready Evidence (Without Inspection Claims)

5.1 Inspection-Ready Oracy Evidence Pack

(formerly “Ofsted Report Card”)

Audience: SLT, Trust Leaders, Governors
Function: Aggregate strand-level oracy evidence into an editable narrative pack aligned with inspection language.

Features
	•	One-click generation of:
	•	School-wide oracy trends
	•	Phase-specific snapshots
	•	Cohort progression narratives
	•	Fully editable text (no locked AI conclusions)

Explicit Disclaimer

SayVeritas curates evidence. Interpretation and judgement remain the responsibility of the school.

This aligns with expectations from Ofsted without implying endorsement.

⸻

6. Equity & Disadvantage Analytics (High-Trust Design)

6.1 Disadvantage Gap Visibility

Optional MIS Integration (V2)
	•	SIMS
	•	Arbor

Auto-Tagging (Where Permitted)
	•	FSM
	•	SEND
	•	EAL

Analytics Output
	•	Cohort-level strand progression comparisons:
	•	Disadvantaged vs Non-Disadvantaged
	•	No individual deficit labelling by default

Safeguard
	•	Individual-level views require elevated permissions.
	•	Default view is trend-based, not diagnostic.

⸻

7. Curriculum & Qualification Integration

7.1 GCSE-Aligned Oracy Prompt Packs

Pre-built, editable prompt banks aligned to high-stakes expectations:
	•	English Language
	•	Spoken Language Endorsement practice
	•	Science
	•	Oral explanations of Required Practicals
	•	History
	•	Structured significance and causation explanations

Prompts mirror exam-board language without claiming accreditation.

⸻

8. Safeguarding & Compliance (Non-Negotiable)

8.1 Safeguarding (KCSIE 2025/26)

Aligned with Keeping Children Safe in Education.

AI Role
	•	Keyword and pattern alerts only
	•	No automated safeguarding decisions
	•	All flags routed for human review by DSL

Requirements
	•	Audit log of alerts
	•	False-positive acknowledgement
	•	Manual confirmation step

⸻

9. Data Protection & Residency
	•	UK-based data hosting (e.g. AWS London)
	•	UK-GDPR compliant
	•	Automatic deletion of Year 11 leaver data (31 August)
	•	SAR-ready bulk export tools

⸻

10. UK Teacher-First UX Principles

10.1 Workload Reduction
	•	60-Second Class Insight
	•	3 bullet points per task
	•	Question-led framing:
	•	“Which strand limited explanations of mitosis?”
	•	“Where did vocabulary usage break down?”

10.2 British Voice AI (StudyLab)
	•	British accent options (RP, Estuary)
	•	Optional Teacher Voice Model (record once, reuse)

⸻

11. Explicit Trust Layer (Required)

What SayVeritas UK Does Not Do
	•	Does not grade pupils
	•	Does not predict inspection outcomes
	•	Does not replace teacher judgement
	•	Does not automate safeguarding decisions

This section must appear in:
	•	Sales decks
	•	Privacy documentation
	•	Pilot onboarding

⸻

12. Early Traction & Adoption Strategy (Insider Angles)

Beyond early pilots with Voice 21-affiliated schools:
	1.	Multi-Academy Trust pilots (centralised evidence wins)
	2.	ITT / ECF providers (habit formation at entry point)
	3.	Inspection-readiness CPD webinars
	4.	Local Authority oracy leads
	5.	Trust-level dashboards before individual teacher rollout

⸻

13. Build Phasing (Critical)

MVP
	•	Strand profiles
	•	Individual & class insights
	•	Editable evidence packs
	•	UK compliance baseline

V2
	•	MIS integrations
	•	Social strand group analytics
	•	MAT-level rollups

⸻

14. Next Development Artifact

Required next step:
A Mapping Document that shows:
	•	Current US rubric → Voice 21 progression language
	•	Year 7 vs Year 11 expectations by strand
	•	Internal AI prompt rewrites (technical)
	•	External teacher-facing alignment explainer (non-technical)

This becomes both:
	•	A build spec
	•	A trust-building sales document

⸻

Bottom Line

With this framing, SayVeritas UK is no longer “an oracy tool.”

It becomes the safest, most inspection-credible way for schools to survive and succeed in an Oracy-First system—at precisely the moment the system is underprepared.
