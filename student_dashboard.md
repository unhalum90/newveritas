Web App UI Enhancement Discussion

Blake pointed out problems with pop-up windows, including difficulty closing them and a lack of a cancel button, as well as incomplete dark mode coverage and a 20-pixel clear space at the bottom of the browser. They also discussed the need for clearer labeling and options in the cookie message, as well as the importance of including a default image when none is provided. Eric agreed with Blake's suggestions and proposed using the class name as a placeholder image. They also addressed confusion caused by the wording and date display of a pulse check-in feature.

Digital Pulse Check Evolution
Eric discussed the evolution of pulse checks, from analog methods to digital solutions, emphasizing the need to reduce friction for students accessing these assessments. He proposed using a unique, one-time code system to streamline the process, ensuring ease of use even in environments without consistent internet access. Eric also explained the varied usage of homework and assessments across different subjects and schedules, highlighting the flexibility needed in implementing such tools.
Learning Management System UX Improvements
Blake and Eric discussed the user interface and functionality of a learning management system, focusing on improving the onboarding process and user experience. They identified several issues, including a problematic navigation flow, unclear labeling, and aesthetic inconsistencies. Eric acknowledged the need to fix these issues, such as changing the "switch account" text to "log out," adding breadcrumbs for better navigation, and improving the practice space onboarding. They also discussed the importance of ensuring that students complete the practice space walkthrough before accessing other features and agreed to simplify the interface by removing unnecessary elements like arrows and improving the readability of text on pop-ups.
