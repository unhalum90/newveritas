B. What to Pull for the Dev / Product Team

1. Assessment must prioritise process over correctness

Requirement
	•	Detect reasoning moves, not just answers.
	•	Support half-formed ideas, hesitation, reformulation.

Implication
	•	AI scoring must tolerate:
	•	fillers (“erm”, “like”)
	•	self-correction
	•	exploratory talk patterns

⸻

2. Multi-dimensional oracy is non-negotiable

Requirement
	•	All assessment maps to:
	•	Physical
	•	Linguistic
	•	Cognitive
	•	Social / Emotional

Implication
	•	No single “oracy score”
	•	Strand profiles required
	•	Progress tracked per strand over time

⸻

3. Teachers need monitoring summaries, not raw data

Requirement
	•	Teachers cannot review 20–30 recordings deeply.
	•	Document repeatedly stresses teacher judgement, not automation.

Implication
	•	“60-second class insight” summaries
	•	Highlight:
	•	common misconceptions
	•	weak strands
	•	exemplary reasoning snippets

⸻

4. Group talk matters as much as individual talk

Requirement
	•	Exploratory talk in pairs/trios is repeatedly cited.
	•	Turn-taking, building, challenging are core skills.

Implication
	•	Group-mode analysis:
	•	participation balance
	•	response chaining (“I agree with… because…”)
	•	challenge vs cumulative talk

⸻

5. Longitudinal evidence is critical

Requirement
	•	Schools compare:
	•	pre/post interventions
	•	year-over-year progression
	•	Ofsted expects impact over time.

Implication
	•	Versioned recordings
	•	Before/after comparisons
	•	Student self-reflection stored alongside AI feedback

⸻

6. EAL-aware analysis is essential

Requirement
	•	Translanguaging is endorsed.
	•	Home language use is acceptable during thinking.

Implication
	•	AI must:
	•	avoid penalising code-switching
	•	separate language proficiency from reasoning quality
	•	Tagging by EAL status matters for analytics, not scoring bias

⸻

7. Scaffolds must be removable

Requirement
	•	Scaffolds start the journey but must fade.
	•	Independence is an explicit goal.

Implication
	•	Prompt scaffolding levels:
	•	heavy → light → none
	•	Ability to track scaffold reliance over time

⸻

8. Reporting must be narrative-ready

Requirement
	•	Schools need inspection-ready language.
	•	Quantification alone is insufficient.

Implication
	•	Narrative report templates:
	•	“What improved”
	•	“Why it matters”
	•	“Evidence examples”
	•	Exportable artefacts (PDFs)
